## About this How To Section  

We're sharing information in this How To section on recommendations for certain software and ways to use it on the CCR systems.  There are certainly multiple ways to do anything so you're welcome to experiment on your own.  The information provided here may not be exactly as you experience it.  Please expect some differences and utilize your favorite search engine for additional assistance.

### Nomenclature Used  

For these examples, we assume you have access to a shared group project directory located in `/projects/academic` or `/projects/industry`  If you do not already have a directory for yourself within your group's project directory, we recommend you create one and then create a directory structure for your software installations, Python virtual environments, Anaconda environments, and local R and Perl library installations. However, how you organize your software is up to you and your research group.  Throughout this documentation, we use this structure where `yourgroup=your group's directory name` and `$USER=your username`  

!!! Note "Don't have a project directory?"  
    If you do not have a shared group directory, one can be requested by the faculty member leading the group or course via the [ColdFront alllocations portal](../portals/coldfront.md).  We do NOT recommend you install software in your home directory as most applications will quickly use up the small home directory quota.

In these How To documents we provide a suggested directory layout which keeps things organized by [$CCR_VERSION](../software/releases.md).  This may help ease the transition when CCR releases a new version of the compatibility layer in the future.  It will at least help you organize the different software versions.  However, using this variable this is not required.
