# CCR Support Policy  

CCR staff provide systems and user support during regular business hours, Monday through Friday 8am-5pm excluding University at Buffalo holidays.  No weekend support is provided.  


## Emergencies

Emergency support is provided off-hours for critical infrastructure outages only (i.e. storage, networking, batch scheduler, cooling, electric, and cloud infrastructure) that affect large numbers of users.  We are unable to provide emergency support for individual cloud instance or compute node outages.  

## Requesting Support  

Requests for support are to be submitted through the [CCR help portal](https://ubccr.freshdesk.com) or by emailing CCR Help and are handled on a first come, first served basis.  We strive to respond within 2 business days to all requests for help.  Though hardware and software installations and configurations may take longer, they are usually completed within two weeks.  Please see the [CCR Help page for more information](../help.md).
