# Two Factor Authentication Reset Policy  

If a CCR user has lost access to the app they used to generate the time-based one-time passwords they will not be able to login to their CCR account or modify the two-factor authentication settings.  Users must contact CCR help to request the removal of this security feature.  In order to verify the account owner's identity, the user will be directed to present photo identification to a CCR staff member.  Details will be provided once you initiate [contact with CCR help](../help.md).  

Once we receive this information, we will remove the two-factor authentication setting from your account and you'll be able to login with your password.
