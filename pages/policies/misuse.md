# Permitted Usage

The University at Buffalo's Center for Computational Research maintains servers, clusters, and websites designed for UB's faculty and staff researchers, their students and external collaborators, and industry customers.  All users of CCR systems are required to comply with ALL of the University at Buffalo's Information Technology Policies as well as all CCR policies both explicitly stated here as well as implicitly.  In other words, just because you CAN do something, doesn't mean you SHOULD do it.  

!!! Warning  
    Please refer to the [University at Buffalo's Computer and Network Use Policy](http://www.buffalo.edu/administrative-services/policy1/ub-policy-lib/computer-network-use.html) as the University's policies applies to all CCR resources as well.  


Every time you login to a CCR server via SSH, you are presented with a login banner which states the CCR Computing and Network Use Policy (CNUP), detailed here: https://buffalo.edu/ccr/support/policies.html  

This login banner is also viewable on the OnDemand dashboard.  However, even if it is not explicitly displayed, any CCR server, website, or other resource you login to managed by CCR requires your acknowledgement and agreement to comply with this policy.  

==If you do not agree with the CCR CNUP, you are required to log off immediately==



## Misuse of Systems and Abuse of Account

We reserve the right to disable any account, without prior notice, that is causing problems internally, externally or violating the University at Buffaloâ€™s information technology policies, CCR policies, and/or the laws of New York State or the United States of America.  Users committing such offenses may be reported to the University at Buffalo's IT security officer or the local authorities.

!!! Danger
    UB nor CCR accounts are NOT TO BE SHARED with anyone.  There is no reason whatsoever to share your password, authentication credentials or SSH keys with anyone.  Doing so will result in your CCR account being deactivated and your actions being reported to the University at Buffalo's IT security office  

### Did you know?  
CCR offers project storage space for groups to securely share data and can work with your group to support this collaboration.  Do NOT share your account with anyone.

### Attempts to circumvent policies  

**Fairshare system for batch job scheduling:**  
The clusters' batch queuing system is designed to give everyone a fair shot at the highest level of throughput for their jobs.  Attempting to circumvent the queue or fairshare system (i.e. cut to the front of the line) is strictly prohibited and will result in your account being deactivated and potential disciplinary action by the University at Buffalo IT security office.  

**Scratch Scrubber Policy**  
CCR provides free, high throughput scratch storage space for use when running your jobs.  However, this is TEMPORARY storage space intended for transient storage while jobs are running.  Users are expected to move their data from /pananas/scratch to their home or project directory when their job is complete.  Any data over 60 days old is deleted automatically nightly.  Any efforts to modify file dates to purposely subvert this policy are prohibited.  We have sophisticated scripts that monitor for attempts to subvert the system.  Users violating this policy risk ALL of their data in /panasas/scratch being deleted without notice and account deactivation.   


!!! Warning
    Violation of CCR policies is a violation of UB Computing and Use policies.  Offenders can be referred to the University at Buffalo's IT security office for disciplinary procedures.
