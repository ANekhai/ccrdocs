## How do I get access?

## Why do I get this error message?

## What is my CCR username?

Your CCR username is the same as your UBIT username.  If you do not have a UB account, your CCR username is usually the first letter of your first name plus your last name.  However, if you're unsure, please contact CCR Help [via the helpdesk portal](https://ubccr.freshdesk.com) or by emailing ccr-help @ buffalo.edu.

!!! Note  
    CCR's help desk portal provided by Freshdesk uses email address as the login name for our accounts.  You can create a Freshdesk account with your preferred email address; however, this is not linked to your CCR system account.  The first time you contact CCR Help via email, a Freshdesk account is automatically created for you.
