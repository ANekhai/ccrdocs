# ColdFront

ColdFront is an open source resource allocation management tool built for high
performance computing centers that allows the management of Center resources
and user allocations to those resources.  CCR developed this tool to allow our
users the opportunity to request and manage the access they and their students
or collaborators have to the many resources in CCR's data center.  In order to
obtain access to any CCR services, you must be on an active allocation for the
resource.  Research faculty principal investigators and teaching faculty are
able to create projects in ColdFront and request allocations to CCR resources
for themselves and their group members or students.  

Getting started with ColdFront is easy and all you need is a CCR user account.
Don't have one yet? [see here](../getting-access.md). Faculty members and principal investigators (PIs)
can use ColdFront to:

- [Request an Allocation](#request-an-allocation)
- [Add or Remove users](#add-or-remove-users)
- [Complete yearly project review](#complete-yearly-project-review)

If you're not a faculty member or a PI you can still [login to
ColdFront](https://coldfront.ccr.buffalo.edu) and view information about the
projects you're on and what resources you have access to but you will not be
able to request allocations.

!!! Warning "VPN Required"
    Access to ColdFront is restricted to UB and Roswell Park networks
    (either on campus or connected to their VPN services). [See here](../getting-access.md#vpn-access)


## Request an Allocation

Access to CCR resources is managed in ColdFront using Projects and Allocations.

Projects capture information about your research including your group members
and any allocations to resources. Most PIs have a single project which best
describes their research performed at CCR. After logging into ColdFront for the
first time, you should see the `Add a project` button to create a new project
for your group.  This is required before requesting allocations. Once your
project has been created take a moment to add any publications, grants, or
research output which helps us keep track of the scientific impact of our
center. You can also [add users](#add-or-remove-users) to your project.

To request an allocation to a CCR resource follow these easy steps:

1. Login to [ColdFront](https://coldfront.ccr.buffalo.edu)
2. Create a project or select an existing project
3. Under the `Allocations` section click on the `Request Resource Allocation` button
4. Select the desired resource from the drop down
5. Select the users who should have access to this allocation. To add users to your project [see here](#add-or-remove-users)
6. Enter a justification and click submit

Once you submit your allocation request it will be reviewed by center staff
members and you will receive an email confirmation once it's approved.

**Not sure what to request an allocation for?** [Check out this for more information](../available-resources.md)  

!!! Tip "Allocation Renewals"
    Allocations are approved for a specific time period (most commonly 1 year).
    You will have the option to renew your allocation before the expiration
    date to continue using the resources. If your allocation is not renewed by
    the end date your access will be revoked.  You will receive email reminders
    well in advance of your allocation expiration.

## Add or Remove users

Users can be added or removed to your project in ColdFront. To add a user to
your project they must already have a CCR account. Please direct them to [these
instructions](../getting-access.md) to create their own CCR user account.

To add users to your project, follow these steps:

1. Login to [ColdFront](https://coldfront.ccr.buffalo.edu)
2. Click on your project
3. Under the `Users` section click the `Add User` button
4. Enter in the users UBIT username or first/last name or email address (be sure to select `All Fields` radio button)
5. Click the `Search` button and a list of users will be displayed
6. Select the users by checking the box next to their name and click `Add selected users to project` button.

You can also remove users from your project by clicking on your project and
under the `Users` section click on the `Remove User` button.

!!! Tip "Delegate Manager Role"
    When adding a user to your project you can optionally designate them as a
    "Manager" by selecting their role using the drop down next to their email.
    A "Manager" is a user who has the same permissions as the PI to add/remove
    users, request/renew allocations, add/remove project info such as grants,
    publications, and research output.  Managers may also complete the annual
    project review. You can also modify a users role at any time by clicking on
    the `Edit` button next to the user's name.

**Notifications** - all users on a project will receive notifications about
allocations including reminders of upcoming expiration dates and status
changes.  Users may uncheck the box next to their username to turn off
notifications.  Managers and PIs on the project are not able to turn off
notifications.  

## Complete yearly project review

CCR requires the annual review of all projects.  We ask that PIs or project
managers update the project description and field of science, if necessary, and
remove any users that should no longer have access.  During this review we ask
that you update your grant and publication information to ensure it is
up-to-date. This information is used in reports CCR provides to UB's
adminsitration demonstrating the research and work CCR's resources enable each
year.

When your project review is required, you will see a banner at the top of the
project detail page that includes a link to the project review process along
with `You need to review this project`

!!! Warning  
    New allocation requests and allocation renewals are not accepted until the project review has been submitted.
