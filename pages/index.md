# CCR Research Computing Documentation

The [Center for Computational Research (CCR)](https://buffalo.edu/ccr) at the [University at Buffalo](https://buffalo.edu) is a high-performance research computing center offering faculty, staff, students, and local businesses access to supercomputing environments, high-end visualization services, an on-premise research cloud infrastructure, and experienced staff to help you move your research forward.  

This documentation covers the use of CCR's research computing and research cloud resources. More general information about CCR can be found on [our website](https://buffalo.edu/ccr).  Information about CCR support services can be [found here](help.md).   

!!! Tip   
    CCR provides UB's research computing and research cloud resources. All other IT services and support at UB are provided by [UBIT](https://buffalo.edu/ubit)
