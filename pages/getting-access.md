# Getting access to CCR

CCR offers a variety of resources for researchers to use in their own projects.
Regardless of what resources you want to use, you need to start by:

- [Creating a CCR user account](#creating-a-ccr-user-account)
- [Get added to an active allocation for the resource(s) you want to use](#requesting-an-allocation-in-coldfront)

## Creating a CCR user account

Users with UB or Roswell Park email addresses can create themselves a CCR user account following [these directions](../portals/idm/#create-a-ccr-system-account).  Once your account is created, make sure to [follow the instructions for enabling two factor authentication](../portals/idm/#managing-two-factor-authentication).  Now it's time to request access to the resources or services you want to use.

## Requesting an Allocation in ColdFront

ColdFront is CCR's resource and allocation management system.  ColdFront manages all of CCR's resources and the access all users have to those resources.  Faculty members (Principal investigators) must create themselves a project in ColdFront, request allocations for the resources their group wants to use, and then add their group members to their project.  Once an allocation is activated, users on that allocation will be able to access the resource.  [More details about ColdFront can be found here](../portals/coldfront.md).

- If you're a faculty member/PI/professor, [follow these instructions](../portals/coldfront/#project-setup)  
- If you're a staff member/postdoc/student, contact whomever is sponsoring your account to request that they add you to their project and allocation(s).    
- If you're an external collaborator, the faculty member you're working with needs to request a CCR account & VPN access via CCR Help  
- If you're an industry cluster customer, please [submit a ticket to](https://ubccr.freshdesk.com) or email CCR Help (ccr-help_at_buffalo.edu) to request access
