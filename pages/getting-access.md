# Getting access to CCR

CCR offers a variety of resources for researchers to use in their own projects.
To get started with CCR resources you need the following:

- [UB or Roswell Park VPN](#vpn-access)
- [A CCR user account](#creating-a-ccr-user-account)
- [Enable Two Factor Authentication](#enable-two-factor-authentication)
- [An active allocation to the resources you want to use](#allocation-requests)

## VPN Access

Access to all CCR resources, including creating accounts is restricted to UB
and Roswell Park networks. You must be either on campus or connected to
[UBVPN](https://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/service-guides/connecting/vpn.html) or
Roswell Park VPN. For more information on connecting to UBVPN [see here](https://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/service-guides/connecting/vpn/computer.html).
If you do not have a UBIT account or a Roswell Park user account please
[contact CCR Help](help.md) to inquire about VPN access.

## Creating a CCR user account

CCR resources are freely available to the UB and Roswell Park research
communities. You must create an individual CCR account and enable two factor
authentication if you wish to access any CCR resources. Please note that CCR
user accounts are separate from your UBIT or Roswell Park accounts. 

A CCR user account can be created quickly and easily by [by filling out the
form here](https://idm.ccr.buffalo.edu/signup) using your UB or Roswell Park
email address. Once your account is created you will need to verify your email
address and enable two factor authentication. 

## Enable Two Factor Authentication

CCR requires all user accounts to have two factor authentication enabled. We
support OTP, which stands for One-Time Passcodes and is a common form of two
factor authentication (2FA). OTP is also known as app based authentication,
software tokens, or soft tokens where an app on your phone will generate unique
numeric passcodes as a second factor to provide increased account security.

To enable two factor authentication on your account, follow these easy steps:

1. Install an authenticator app on your phone. Authentication apps like Authy,
   Google Authenticator, and Duo are supported. We recommend Duo as it's also used by UBIT.

2. Login to CCR IDM portal [here](https://idm.ccr.buffalo.edu/) and click on
   [OTP Tokens](https://idm.ccr.buffalo.edu/otp) in the side menu.

3. Click on the "New Token" button and follow the directions to scan the QR
   code using your authenticator app. Enter the six digit passcode generated by the app.

You can also watch the video below which details the entire process:

## Allocation Requests

Access to CCR resources is managed using allocations. ColdFront is the
allocations management system CCR uses to manage resource allocations for the
entire center. In order to access CCR resources you must be on an active
allocation. 

- __Faculty members__ (Principal investigators) can create projects in ColdFront,
  add group members, and request allocations to resources.  Once an allocation
  is activated, users on that allocation will be able to access the resource.
  More details about ColdFront can be found [here](portals/coldfront.md).

- __Students and postdocs__ can contact the faculty member (PI) who is
  sponsoring your account to request that they add you to their project and
  allocations.

- __External Collaborators__ the faculty member you're working with needs to
  request a CCR account and VPN access by [contacting CCR Help](help.md)

- __Industry customers__ please [contact CCR Help](help.md) to request access.
